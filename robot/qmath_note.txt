This project uses the Qmath library from TI. Setting up the project so
it will compile requires downloading and installing the library, and
if you install in the same place that I did (I think it's the
default), then everything shouod just work. Otherwise, you may have to
change the definition of IQMATHLIB_ROOT in the project properties so
the compiler can find the library. The example applications that
install with the library have the correct settings, so that can be
helpful.
