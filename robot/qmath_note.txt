This project uses the Qmath library from TI. Setting up the project so
it will compile requires downloading and installing the library,
following the instructions to create the empty example project,
deleting the main source file, and adding/linking to these source
files. It's not a great solution, and perhaps later I'll see if the
library settings transfer if I save the whole project here. Until
then, I'm just going to do it this way, sorry...
