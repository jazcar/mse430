Eagle also left a .gpi and a .dri file, those can be ignored.

Note: I marked "No" on "Route and Retain" because I understood that to mean 
that it would be in a panel with tabs, which I don't want. I do want the out 
edge of the board cut out, however, so if I misunderstood that and need to 
change something, please email me asap.
